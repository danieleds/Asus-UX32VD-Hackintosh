####What's inside this repo
 - A working DSDT + SSDT: [EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/](EFI/CLOVER/ACPI/patched/).
 - Instructions on how the DSDT has been made, in case you want to patch your own: [src/DSDT/](src/DSDT/). The SSDT has been generated by [ssdtPRgen](https://github.com/Piker-Alpha/ssdtPRGen.sh) v16.5: `./ssdtPRGen.sh -x 1 -lfm 900`.
 - [Clover](http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot/) config.plist and drivers: [EFI/CLOVER/](EFI/CLOVER).
 - The necessary kexts: [Kexts/](Kexts/). Whenever a config.plist of these kexts has been altered, you'll find a config.original.plist in the same directory in case you want to see the differences.
